  Stuff Engineering. Computer science student. Start up lover - working currently on <a href="http://laptopfriendly.in/">http://laptopfriendly.in/</a> and some other interesting projects.
</p>

Currently I am a Computer Science Master student at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch), in Switzerland. I love coding and figuring out new, interesting ways to solve tech problems.

Making products is what really excites me, and engineering something that users love is why I like this job so much.

Everybody's day is full with interesting tech problems to solve, and I would like this to be the place where I can share some part of it. Also, I would like to practice my teaching/writing/being-concise skills, and there is no better way to do that, than occassionally writing a post.

Thanks for reading, and hope you like it!
